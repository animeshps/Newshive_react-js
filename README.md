This project will  not run even after deploying online on for eg. github deploy as it uses a news api which is unpaid and free.... we have to give our own api from any news api websites.
It will run only on local development server such as BY-----   npm start   ------command on terminal and press enter.

that is also a reason of languages showing in making of this project is html only but if api is not fetching data news as it is a unpaid so it will not show css and javascript is also used in making of this website application project.. 
screenshots of project running on my local machine are attached here after...
